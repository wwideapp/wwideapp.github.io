On Tuesday, Apple’s planning on introducing three new iPhones. The most significant of these is the completely redesigned iPhone X/Edition, which will become the first Apple handset with an OLED display.

This 5.8-inch smartphone may be priced at $999 for a 64GB model, $1,099 for a 256GB model, and $1,119 for a 512GB model. Available color choices should include black, white, and brush copper.

Other features should include:

-Water resistance improved to IP68, or perhaps waterproof
-10-nanometer A11 chip
-Wireless Charging, probably using Qi protocol;
-10W USB-C wall charger
-Iris scanning for authentication; infrared face unlock capability
-New sound when charging
-Vertical camera on the back
-The end of the Home button, replaced by facial recognition or a “function area.” No Touch ID on iPhone 8
-Lots of new native wallpapers

The 4.7-inch “iPhone 8” and 5.5-inch “iPhone 8 Plus” are expected to retain the design found on the current iPhone models. Beyond this, little is known about these handsets.

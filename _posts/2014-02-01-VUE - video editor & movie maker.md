Rather than shooting at six-second video raw, use VUE to add some cinematic flair to your video. With a simple interface that allows for quick shooting and customization, this is an app you want to add to your arsenal.

### What is it about?

With VUE, it's almost too easy to shoot videos that look more cinematic than your iPhone's average offerings. You can shoot anywhere from one to four clips that will all add up to six seconds long before making some quick edits. VUE allows for recording in 1-to-1, 16-to-9, and 2.39-to-1 aspect ratios and with a variety of filters that will enhance your video without being overkill. The app also includes some digital stabilization features that make clips more cinematic-looking than usual. After recording, you can tweak visual properties of your video such as brightness, contrast, temperature, and more, along with adding artistic stickers that include the date and time, weather, location, or an emoji image. Although stickers are often seen as childish and playful, these ones look very modern and mature. All in all, VUE makes it easy to add some quality to your short videos without much effort.

### Why wo love it

It's a free way to add some professionalism to the short videos you take on your iPhone. It's almost effortless. What's not to love?

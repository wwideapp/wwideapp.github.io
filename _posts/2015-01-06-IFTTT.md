Featuring Applets, IFTTT allows you to control everything around you with your voice and Amazon Alexa. To date, there are over 360 apps that work with IFTTT, including Twitter, Weather, Email, and devices like Amazon Alexa, and Philips Hue.

**Find What You Want.** With the IFTTT, everything you want is just a few click away. Find the applets you already use -- or want to use with ease.

**By App.** You can easily find applets by app or device. Find the applets already created for one of these or find new ones. Or create your own.

**Search.** Search shouldn't have to be difficult, and it's not in the IFTTT app. You'll always know which applets you're already using and find new ones that might interest you based on your past experience. Yourâ€‹ only limitation is your imagination.

The only camera app you'll ever need.
Lightricks, and the Enlight app name, have become synonymous with excellent photo editing. With the latest app in the developer's stable, the names are going to become known for taking great pictures, too

The camera that rotates with you. Lightricks recognizes how frustrating it can be getting a straight shot by hand, and has included a Quickshot mode that automatically aligns photos and more.

Batch edit your photos. You can batch edit up to three photos in the free version, or many more with the pro subscription of Quickshot.

Plenty of filters to choose from. Lightricks Enlight is known for its plentiful filters, and Quickshot is no exception.

### What is it about?

I've been using Enlight for quite some time, moving over to Enlight 2 Photofox when it released. Because of the ease of use and plentiful features Lightricks includes in its apps, they've become my go-to choices for photo editing of all sorts.

### Why wo love it

Of course, sometimes you don't want to rely on Quickshot mode. You want an HDR image, or need to capture fast-moving action with the Strobe mode. When you edit your photos, you want ease of operations there, too. Enlight has become well-known for offering plenty of filters and adjustment controls, and Quickshot is no exception. Almost all of the filters come free with the app. There are filters for nature and urban settings, as well as portrait filters you can use. That's only the beginning. Other filter categories include summer, abstract, night, and black & white. You can enjoy professional-level editing without the hassle of learning all the terms and controls. You also have at your fingertips almost all of the power of the Enlight app itself, along with an excellent camera app. You can adjust brightness, exposure, depth, shadows, highlights, and more. Add more vibrance to your images, adjust the saturation, or change the temperature of the lighting. Full control over your images is included right there, so you can make that boring, drab but essential picture come to life. Here's the best part. Enlight Quickshot includes batch editing, so you can apply the same filter or settings to several photographs. Without a subscription, you're limited to batch editing just three photos, but with the subscription option you can also create your own personalized filters that you save for future use, while also being able to batch edit as many photos as you can tap.

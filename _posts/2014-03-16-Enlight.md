### What is it about?

Enlight is an all-in-one photo editing app that will eliminate the need for multiple apps on your iOS device. With Enlight, you'll have the basics like color adjustment, cropping, and even some filters that can change how your photo looks.

With Enlight on your iOS device, you won't have to worry about not having the right tool for the job, because you'll have them all in one place. It's super convenient and well worth the price tag.

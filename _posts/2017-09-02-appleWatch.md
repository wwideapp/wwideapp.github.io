No designs changes are expected on the third-generation Apple Watch. Internal hardware changes could prove significant, however.

The biggest hardware change could be the introduction of an LTE model for the first time. Other features could include a micro-LED display, better battery, and improved process.

On the hardware side, new exercise routines could be in the offering. The wearable device could soon be able to track workouts for basketball, bowling, climbing, cricket, cross-country skiing, curling, dance, equestrian sports, fencing, fishing, golf, gymnastics, jump rope, pilates, skating, surfing, and more.

Finally, weâ€™ll probably see a new lineup of Apple Watch bands arrive.
